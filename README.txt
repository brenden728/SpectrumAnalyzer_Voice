This is a spectrum analyzer that is terribly unoptimzed and probably does not even show the correct frequency range. Was put together in a few
hours and neglected XD

Keep the SpectrumTest1.exe and the lib files in the same folder because I suck at linking and didn't produce a standalone exe

!!!To run the cpp, you need to link the SFML and FFTW libraries
in the debug setup I used to create this in visual studio I static linked to the debug lib for SFML
